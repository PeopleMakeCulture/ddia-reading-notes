# Designing Data Intensive Applications

## Ch 1 - Reliable, Scalable, Maintainable Applications (pp3 - 23)

#### Thesis

 *Applications use data systmes to store, stash, search, and process data (dbs, caches, search indexes, stream processing, and batch processing).These underlying data systems strive to be reliable, scalable, and maintainable*

#### Summary

- applications must meet _functional requirements_ (what it should do, eg store, search, retrieve, process) and _non-functional requirements_ (how it should be, eg secure, compliant, *R*eliable, *Scalable*, *Maintainable*)

- It's hard to make things RSM, but there are some patterns, which this book will discuss

- *reliable* 

- *scalable*

- *maintainable*

### Outline

### Thinking Data Systems

### Reliability (pp6-11)
	- Hardware
	- Software
	- Humans
	- How important is this anyways??

### Scalability (pp10-18)
	- Load
	- Performance
	- Coping with Load

### Maintainability (pp189-22)
	- Operability
	- Simplicity 
	- Evolvability
